This is a PTE practise app . It has listening section for now and contains a lots of questions. Admin can add questions, questions are of free and paid types, and users can access questions based on their subscription type.
I have used OPENAI audio transcription model whisper for transcribing the audio to text. I have used Stripe for subscription based payment and Firebase for data storage. I am planning to add speaking sections too.
